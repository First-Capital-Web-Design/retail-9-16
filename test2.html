					<h3>Risk Considerations</h3>

								An investment in First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of the Prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our Common Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:


										<ul>

											<li>There is currently no public trading market for our Common Shares, and there may never be one. This is a blind pool offering, so you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them.</li>

											<li>If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number of investments we may make, and the value of your investments in our Common Shares will fluctuate with the performance of the specific investments we make.</li>

											<li>We and our advisor have a limited operating history. We have no established financing sources and the performance of our sponsor's prior real estate investment programs may not be indicative of our future results. Our sponsor has limited experience in managing a public REIT or any other kind of public investment program.</li>

											<li>Following the NAV pricing start date, the purchase of Common Shares under our DRIP and the repurchase of Common Shares under our share repurchase program will be at a price equal to our NAV per Common Share, which will be based upon subjective judgments, and may not reflect the amount that you might receive for your Common Shares in a market transaction.</li>

											<li>Our advisor and its affiliates, including all of our executive officers and some of our directors, will face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us. We will pay our advisor and its affiliates substantial fees for their services, including, among other things, the selection, financing and acquisition of our investments; the management and leasing of our properties; the servicing of our mortgage, bridge, mezzanine or other loans; the administration of our other investments and the disposition of our assets. These fees will reduce the amount of cash available for investment or distributions to shareholders.</li>

											<li>You are limited in your ability to sell your Common Shares pursuant to our share repurchase program.</li>

											<li>We will make some of or all of our distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including the proceeds of our public offering, cash advanced to us by our advisor, cash resulting from a waiver of asset management fees or property management fees or from borrowings (including borrowings secured by our assets). This may reduce the amount of capital we invest and negatively impact the value of your investment.</li>

											<li>There can be no assurance that any distributions will be made, and distributions are not guaranteed.</li>

											<li>There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve expected cash flows necessary to continue to pay initially established distributions or maintain distributions at any particular level, or that distributions will increase over time.</li>

											<li>We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.</li>

											<li>First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated has qualified as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for the tax year 2013, and we intend to make a REIT election for Federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2013.</li>

											<li>The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our Common Shares.</li>

											<li>Real estate-related investments are subject to numerous risks, including risks relating to leverage, tenant nonrenewal, vacancies, inability to sell or refinance on favorable terms or at all, adverse regulatory changes, uninsured losses, adverse market conditions, and environmental hazards, any of which, if realized, could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our Common Shares.</li>

											<li>No offering is made to New York residents except by a Prospectus filed with the Department of Law of the State of New York. The Attorney General of the State of New York has not passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering.</li>

										</ul>

								<h1>Medical Office - Myrtle Beach, SC</h1>
									<h3>Highlights</h3>

										<p>
												The two-story building is leased to the three
												original tenants who have occupied the
												building since it opened in 1998. 72 percent
												of square footage leased rolls in December
												2019, 28 percent rolls in May 2020. Medical
												tenants traditionally have a higher renewal
												rate than standard office tenants.
										</p>
										<p>
												The hospital is a tenant of the property
												and a subsidiary of Hospital Corporation of
												America (HCA), the largest publicly-traded
												for-profit operator of health care facilities in
												the U.S., rated Ba2 by Moody’s. The hospital
												last renewed in 2013 at a 10 percent premium
												to the other tenants.
										</p>
										<p>
												Although there can be no guaranty, the three
												tenants have expressed their intent to renew
												long-term leases due to their long-term investment
												into the property and proximity to
												the hospital.
										</p>
										<p>
												Leases are NN with annual rent increases of
												(i) 3.0 percent or (ii) CPI with a 2.0 percent

								<h1>Tilden House - Brooklyn, New York</h1>
									<h3>Asset Summary</h3>

										<p>The property is a 9-story elevator building with 117 one bedroom and studio apartments comprising 86,360 square feet. The average unit size is 432+/- sq. ft. and each unit has a kitchen, bathroom and other typical apartment necessities. Constructed in 2004, the property was built structurally as a standard apartment building. The property is located in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn between Lott Street and Veronica Place, southeast of Prospect Park. The area is characterized by typical urban residences, row houses and cottage homes, along the side streets and mostly "mom and pop" retail along the main thoroughfares. The area is well served by public transportation.</p>

										<h3>Investment Thesis</h3>

										<p>Given the property's inflation-indexed, long term scheduled rental payments, the REIT believes this asset will contribute to the first objective of it's Dual Strategy; providing the potential for consistent dividend distributions.</p>

										<p>There can be no assurances that these investment objectives will be met, and the achievement of any or all goals is not guaranteed.</p>

								<h1>14 Highland Avenue - Yonkers, New York</h1>
									<h3>Highlights</h3>

										<p>FCRETI has a 14.6 percent ownership interest
												in this property. It is ideally located directly
												off the South Broadway commercial corridor,
												minutes off the Saw Mill River Parkway, just
												north of the Bronx border and a short walk
												to the Metro North Ludlow station. This major
												transit corridor is currently undergoing a
												demographic shift.
										</p>
										<p>
												Although not guaranteed, the asset benefits
												from 99 percent occupancy of low-income
												residents. Future upside potential may include
												capital upgrades of the existing boilers and
												installation of an energy management system
												to reduce overall utility expenses. Additionally,
												cap rate compression since 2013 has resulted
												in appreciation in value by over 40 percent.

										<p>
												This select-service hotel was gut renovated
												in 2013 by prior ownership and is currently
												undergoing significant renovations totaling
												$4.2 million, or approximately $22,000
												per key, to complete the rebranding from an
												independent hotel to a Ramada flag (part of
												the Wyndham Worldwide brand reservation
												system). With $850,000 spent to date, the
												hotel has been officially reflagged Ramada.
												As of December 2015, approximately onethird
												of the guest rooms are renovated and

												8,350 square feet of meeting space, an
												outdoor pool, a fitness room (planned), an
												arcade (planned), a business center (planned),
												a gift shop (planned), a guest laundry room
												(planned), and vending areas.
										</p>
										<p>
												As a result of the rebranding, renovations, and
												new management, revenue has more than
												doubled in the second half of 2015 compared
												to the first half of 2015.

								<h1>Wyndham Garden Inn- Amarillo, TX</h1>
									<h3>Highlights</h3>

										<p>
												This full-service hotel is undergoing significant
												renovations totaling $7.5 million, or over
												$28,000 per key, as part of the Wyndham
												Garden rebranding.
										</p>
										<p>
												Amenities include a lounge/restaurant,
												breakfast dining area, fitness center and
												indoor pool, two lobby business centers,
												guest vending machine on every floor, and a
												third party-operated gift shop.
										</p>
										<p>
												In 2015, $6.0 million was invested in renovating
												the hotel’s lobby, Pour House restaurant,
												back-of-house, common areas, and guest
												rooms on floors one through five. Despite
												only renovating 50 percent of the guest
												rooms through year-end 2015, the positive
												renovation impact can still be seen in the
												June through November increase in Average
												Daily Rate (ADR) of 19.6 percent over prior
												year while the competitive set of properties
												only achieved ADR growth of 5.2 percent.
												Additional RevPAR growth of 28.0 percent
												is budgeted for 2016.
